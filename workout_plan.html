    <h2>Equipment needed:</h2>
    <p>A range of light to heavy pairs of weights (relative to what you can lift for your upper and lower body) are key to helping you get the most out of this challenge. Having more than one weight option will allow you to increase your weights as the challenge progresses in difficulty. A mat/comfortable surface is also recommended for any floorwork.</p>
    <p>The whole FitVision Team worked together to make this challenge happen! </p>
